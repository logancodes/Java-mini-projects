Once there was a male named ushanth. [He/She] was a wizard! One day, an owl came with a letter. It said, "Please come to kegalle and learn magic. You will need to bring a, a and a a. You may also bring one pet. Your ticket for the kegalle Express bus is enclosed!" ushanth went to walmart and bought a black dog and named it dan. Once the shopping was done, ushanth was ready for Magic School! [He/She] hopped on the train and never looked back!
